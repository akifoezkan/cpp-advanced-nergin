lecture notes on advanced topics in cpp

The goal of this repository is to gather lecture notes for the course given by Necati Ergin (https://github.com/necatiergin).
Main purpose is to ultimately have polished notes for myself, thus repeat the course content at a later point. 
However, this takes time since the lectures are quite dense (6 hours per week, taking up my 2 nights after working hours).
Unfortunately, I abuse both English and Turkish languages in these notes since the lectures are held in Turkish whereas I use English in my daily life.

html folder   : consists of polished notes
lec_xx_topic  : unpolished notes written during lectures
lecxx_topic.md: polished content, which I use to export html files
